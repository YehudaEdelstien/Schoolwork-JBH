Question 1:
The global object, the default when running in lazy mode.

Question 2:
The global this, which is the lexical this from where the arrow function was written. 
We can fix the function by turning it into a regular function expression, in which case the value of this will be the object calling the function, which in this case, is myObj.

Question 3:
Whatever is calling the function will pass it's this value to it. If called outside of any function or object, it will be the global object

Question 4:
The global this, which is the lexical this from where the arrow function was written.

Question 5:
The global this, which is the lexical this from where the arrow function was written. we can fix the function by turning it into a regular function expression.
We can fix it by changing the arrow function to a normal function., and then the this value will be the element which is calling the function
